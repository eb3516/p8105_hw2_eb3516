# Problem 1

We clean the 538 `pols` data, which provides information on the number
of national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given
time. There are some values for which `prez_gop` is `2` – these are
months in which Ford became president following Nixon’s resignation. In
the new `president` variable created as part of our data cleaning, we
code these as `gop` (same values as when `prez_gop` is `1`).

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

We also clean the 538 `snp` data, which contains information related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv(
    "./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv",
    col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))) |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    year = if_else(year > 2023, year - 100, year)) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, close) 
```

Finally, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with
the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Now we merge the three datasets.

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)

str(data_538)
```

    ## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
    ##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
    ##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
    ##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
    ##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
    ##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
    ##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
    ##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
    ##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
    ##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
    ##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has 822 observations
and 11 variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution
(democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year
from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting president
was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787 observations and 3
variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment` data has
816 observations and 3 variables ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In
Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the
**average unemployment rate was 6.57**. The average unemployment rate
over the same time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

# Problem 2

We clean the Trash Wheel Collection `Mr. Trash Wheel` data, which
provides information on the dumpster number, date, amount of litter, and
litter type. There are some rows which contain notes/figures and some
columns which contain notes, which will be omitted. Rows which do not
include dumpster-specific data will also be omitted.

``` r
  mrtrash_df = 
    read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
               sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel",
               range="A2:M586")
```

The new `homes_powered` variable will implement a calculation to list
approx number of homes powered.

``` r
  mrtrash_df=
  janitor::clean_names(mrtrash_df) |>
  mutate(kilowatt=weight_tons*500,
         homes_powered=kilowatt/30,
         name="Mr. Trash Wheel",
         year=as.double(year))
```

We repeat the process for Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda Trash Wheel.

``` r
  proftrash_df = 
    read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
               sheet="Professor Trash Wheel",
               range="A2:L108")
```

``` r
  proftrash_df=
  janitor::clean_names(proftrash_df) |>
  mutate(kilowatt=weight_tons*500,
         homes_powered=kilowatt/30,
         name="Professor Trash Wheel",
         year=as.double(year))
```

``` r
  gwynndatrash_df = 
    read_excel("202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",
               sheet="Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
               range="A2:K157")
```

``` r
  gwynndatrash_df=
  janitor::clean_names(gwynndatrash_df) |>
  mutate(kilowatt=weight_tons*500,
         homes_powered=kilowatt/30,
         name="Gwynnda Trash Wheel",
         year=as.double(year))
```

Now we merge the three datasets.

``` r
  combined_wheels_df=bind_rows(mrtrash_df, proftrash_df, gwynndatrash_df)
```

Let’s talk about the Trash Wheel datasets of the 3 combined trash
wheels. The `combined_wheels` data now has 845 observations and 16
variable that tells us about the the amount and type of trash collected
by the Trash Wheels. It consists of variables `dumpster`, `date`,
`weight_tons`, and `volume` and also tells us how many houses are
powered based on the created `homes_powered` variable. There is also a
more specific breakdown of the types of trash collected, including
`plastic`, `polystyrene`, and `cigarette_butts`.

Based on the available data, we can see that Professor Trash Wheel
collected a total of 216.26. We can also see that Gwynnda collected a
total of 1.63^{4} in July of 2021.

# Problem 3

We clean the MCI data collection `baseline` data, which provides
information on the age, sex, education, and APOE4 carrier status. There
are some rows (participants) who do not have a MCI age of onset value,
and those will be omitted.

``` r
  baseline_df=read.csv("./data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip=1)|>
    janitor::clean_names()
```

``` r
  baseline_df= baseline_df |>
  mutate(
    sex=as.double(sex),
    sex=case_match(sex,
                  1 ~ "Male",
                  0 ~ "Female"))
```

``` r
  baseline_df= baseline_df |>
  mutate(
    apoe4=as.double(apoe4),
    apoe4=case_match(apoe4,
                    1 ~ "Carrier",
                    0 ~ "Non-Carrier"))
```

``` r
  baseline_df= baseline_df |>
  mutate(
    id=as.double(id)
      ) |>
  filter(age_at_onset!=".")
```

\#Discuss important steps in the import process & relevant features of
the dataset \#How many participants were recruited & of these how many
develop MCI? \#What is the average baseline age? \#What proportion of
women in the study are APOE4 carriers?

\#Import, clean & tidy dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker
values \#Comment on the steps on the import process & features of the
datset

\#Check whether some participants appear in only baseline or amyloid
